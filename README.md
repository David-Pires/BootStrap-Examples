#BootStrap# 

With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:

href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>

#Adding classes


Starting to nest all of our HTML in a div 

: #class="container-fluid"#  -  It will make all content inside of this div responsive;

Add this class to a img tag

: #class="img-responsive"#   - Image with the exactly the width of our phone's screen; 

: #class="text-center"# - Centering elements on the page.

Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones.

: #class="btn"#
: #class="btn btn-default"#
: #class="btn btn-block"#  This button would take up 100% of the available width.
